            <li>
                <strong>Temperature:<br></strong>
                Make sure the yeast is in a warm environment,<br>
                so fill the glass pot with hot water first and let it get warm then drop the water.
                now use <em>warm</em> water about 100 degrees, not cold or hot.
            </li>
            <br>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Pre-mix:<br></strong>
                Add about 3/4 cup of <em>warm</em> water, half tbsp of sugar, packet of yeast, <br>
                now stir the mix and cover it up for about 5-7 minutes till some bubbles come up on surface.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Dry-mix:<br></strong>

                the remaining 1/2 tbsp of sugar and give the combination a whisk.

                Now into steering the Ready yeast in bowl 1 with bowl 2 dry ingredients, <br>
                using any tool but we will use the dough hook attached to a stand mixer.
                Now into whisking the yeast and adding our flower bit by bit,<br>
                it will take a couple of minutes to get into good form.<br>
                you can add a little flour if it's wet or a sparkle of water if it feels a bit dry. 
            </li>
            <br>
            
            <li>

                sprinkle some flour on a flat surface and make the mixed dough into a ball, <br>
                Bring a bowl and cover it with some oil, put the dough in the bowl and cover it too.<br>
                Leave it in a warm cozy place, an oven can be a good choice.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                <strong>Rolling the dough:<br></strong>
                Now it the dough is doubled in size, punch it down to bring air out,<br>
                and start rolling the dough on the flat surface, can lift it and stretch it out <br>
                and pinch the borders, brush the surface with a bit of oil (especially the crust)
            </li>
            <br>

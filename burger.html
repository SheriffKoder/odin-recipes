        <h4>
            Steps
        </h4>

        <ol>

            <li>
                <strong>The burger patty: pre heat<br></strong>
                take the minced meat into your palm, make it into a ball and try to press a litle bit <br>
                while making shape to make it more firm and keep its shape for later <br>
                then punch it down to take the shape of a burger patty.<br>
                preferred to leave in freezer for a couple of minutes to take shape.

            </li>
            <br>
            
            <li>
                <strong>The burger patty: heat<br></strong>
                Bring a skillet, put in it a bit of water and leave the patty for some time <br>
                to get cooked about 40-45 mins for a well-done.

            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                <strong>The burger patty: prepare<br></strong>
                remove any excess water from the skillet or move the patty <br>
                to another skillet as the meat is cooked and still have moisture inside <br>
                from the water (if patty stored, pre heat it with some water to keep the moisture inside), <br>
                place 1.5-2 tbsp of cooking oil under the patty and let it take <br>
                a darker color a couple of minutes each size, medium flame.<br>
                the cheese slice can be put when the patty is finished, will melt in seconds.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                <strong>Making the sandwich:<br></strong>
                Warm up the burger bun on a skillet for a minute (can add some butter for taste).<br>
                place on the lower level the lettuce slice, above it the cooked patty, above the patty some pickles.<br>
                now on the upper bun slice put some <em>sauce</em> and the tomato slices, place that bun over the patty 
            </li>
